# Coursework
<h4>"bork bork meow" is from my coursework at General Assembly 2018 </h4>

"bork bork meow" is a browser based game of tic tac toe. The game was built using
HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery/Ajax. In order to pass class requirements,
the tic tac toe game must interface with General Assembly's server using
JSON.

"bork bork meow" is a cute take on tic tac toe, where two players face off to
settle the age old question "cats or dogs?" Players need to log into GA's server
through the game in order to play. Once logged in, users may change their passwords,
play the game, query the amount of games played and log out.

## Â¡DISCLAIMER!
I do not control the servers used to create this application. This app's functionality
is entirely at the mercy of General Assembly and their continued maintenance
of the game's server.

## Project Objectives:
- Command Line: Interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem
from the command line.
- Source Control: Managing and interacting with a git repository to store
changes to code.
- Programming Fundamentals: Working with objects, constructors, and events, while
learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- Web Fundamentals: Structuring, styling, and animating documents within a
browser; responding to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- Browser Applications: Using AJAX to connect to a back-end application.
- Server Applications: We haven't covered a ton of server-side technologies yet
(that's up next), but we learned a bit about how API endpoints work, and how to get data from them.
- Security: With JavaScript closures, scratching the surface of why security matters.
- Deployment: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment (GitHub Pages)
- Products and Teams: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.

## User stories
As a user I would like:
-to sign up with email and password
-to be notified if I make a mistake
-to to be notified if I do something succesfully
-to sign in with email and password
-to play tic tac toe
-to start a new game
-to be able to play multiple games without refreshing the page
-to click a square to add my token
-to be notified of a win or draw

## Version Control
I plan on using github's branches to deploy different features. The individual
features that I would like to target are: user signup/authentication, the game
mechanics, user's experience (number of games, game logic etc.)

## Unsolved issues
- Condense the JQuery handlers into one line of code
- Condense the win conditions into an object or array

## Future Features
If there is extra time, I would like to create a multiplayer version, so that
two people could play on different devices.
